                    <br>In this study, you will be asked to perform tasks where you will see different stimuli appear on the computer screen. You will respond by pressing a key or using a computer mouse. In some studies, you will begin by taking a short pre-test, and then move onto the real study. In order for us to accept the results and pay you, you have to pass the pre-test and finish the whole study. The pre-test is easy and if you do not pass it, there is probably something wrong with your browser and you will have to return the HIT.
